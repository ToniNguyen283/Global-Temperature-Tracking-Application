# Global-Temperature-Tracking-Application
Extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity over the next century. Mapping individual events like hurricanes and heat waves to a single root cause is nearly impossible due to the chaotic nature of earth's weather, but we can find surprisingly consistent results when we observe trends across the globe.

To assist with this issue, I came up with a solution to build an application that can access and update the real time record of global temperature across all the locations around the world so that scientist can analyze the changing trends of the temperature.
