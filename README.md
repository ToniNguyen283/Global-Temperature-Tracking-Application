# Global-Temperature-Record-System
Extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity over the next century. Mapping individual events like hurricanes and heat waves to a single root cause is nearly impossible due to the chaotic nature of earth's weather, but we can find surprisingly consistent results when we observe trends across the globe.

To assist with this issue, I came up with a solution to build an application that can access and update the real time record of global temperature across all the locations around the world so that scientist can analyze the changing trends of the temperature.

What I used in this application?
- Applying the hash table and mapping techniques to keep track of every single record of the temperature change in every location
- Applying the polymorphism feature of class to build the Local Record class (for single record) and Records Map class (for multiple records)
- Writing the test case for each class to make sure no errors happen
